For your firebase_core version is seems to be sufficient to pass the FirebaseOptions once you initialize firebase in your flutter code (and you don't need any script tags in your index.html):

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    // Replace with actual values
    options: FirebaseOptions(
      apiKey: "XXX",
      appId: "XXX",
      messagingSenderId: "XXX",
      projectId: "XXX",
    ),
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}
Alternatively, one can also follow the updated official documentation and use the Firebase CLI to automatically create a firebase_options.dart file in your lib folder that will define the correct FirebaseOptions for you. The steps are:

Install Flutterfire CLI:
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
Configure Flutterfire (run in your project's root and go through the wizard selecting the correct Firebase project and target platforms):
flutterfire configure
Import the automatically generated firebase_options.dart file in your main.dart file and initialize Firebase as follows:
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}
